# welcome to coding with github copilot âœ¨

## what is this repository?
this repository was initially created for a microsoft stu internal event to show our colleagues how easy it is to code with gh copilot, how it feels to develop with an autocomplete on steriods and teach them how to inspire customers to use gh copilot.

2. get access to github copilot
    1. microsofties can request access to gh copilot [here](https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/orgs/MicrosoftCopilot)
    2. everyone else can buy a licence [here](https://copilot.github.com/) (it's free for students + teachers!)
3. setup

    1. build a container image with the container registry
    1. create a managed identity
    1. get the id of the managed identity and store it in a variable
